  <h3>What I'm Working On</h3>
    <p>Transforming from <br>
      Information(my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai International Studies University) <br>
      to <br>
      Computer Science(my Master's degree at <A HREF="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-studies/mse-programs/">Johns Hopkins University</A>)<br>
    <h4>Why This Transformation?</h4>
      <p>
         In my undergraduate studies, my advisor, <A HREF="http://baojunma.com/index_en.html">Prof. Baojun Ma, gave me several hand-on coding projects. 
          I soon fell for the feeling of solving problems with codes, just like engineers.<br>
         I then learned the basics of Deep Learning & Neural Networks from the 
          <A HREF="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">coursera courses by Andrew Ng</A> and found them very interesting.<br>
         And then I decided to learn computer science to go deeper.
      </p>
    <h4>How I'm Transformaing?</h4>
      <p>
         I'm focusing on Natrual Language Processing. I'm also pursuing the 
          <A HERF="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/human-language-technology-masters/">Human Language Technology (HLT) Masters Concentration</A> offered by 
          <A HERF="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu">JHU's CLSP</A>.
