  <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
    <p>Transforming from <br>
      Information(my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai International Studies University) <br>
      to <br>
      Computer Science(my Master's degree at <A HREF="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-studies/mse-programs/">Johns Hopkins University</A>)<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Why This Transformation?</h4>
      <p>
         In my undergraduate studies, my advisor, <A HREF="http://baojunma.com/index_en.html">Prof. Baojun Ma</A>, gave me several hand-on coding projects. 
          I soon fell for the feeling of solving problems with codes, just like engineers.<br><br>
         I then learned the basics of Deep Learning & Neural Networks from the 
          <A HREF="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Coursera courses</A> by Dr. Andrew Ng and found them very interesting.<br><br>
         And then I decided to learn computer science to go deeper.
      </p>
    <h4>How I'm Transformaing?</h4>
      <p>
         I'm focusing on Natrual Language Processing. I'm also pursuing the 
          <A HREF="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/human-language-technology-masters/">Human Language Technology (HLT) Masters Concentration</A> offered by 
          <A HREF="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu">JHU's CLSP</A>.
      </p>
    
  <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the following projects are official projects, with designated responsible institutions, clear goals, teamworks, pays and deadlines. 
       Some are school projects, like projects assigned by advisor, or course projects. And the rest are self-motivated projects.
    </p>
   <h3>Patient Fall Risk Assessment Project</h3>
    <p>
      This is a sub-project under the 
       <A HREF="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/physical_medicine_rehabilitation/education_training/amp/">Activity and Mobility Promotion (AMP)</A> project 
       with designated responsible institutions of <A HREF="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/">The Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</A> 
       and <A HREF="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/">Johns Hopkins Hospital</A> <br><br>
      The project aims to understand the role of mobility for hospitalized patients and make assessment for patients' falling risks.<br><br>
      I'm working as a data analytic intern, with several Professors and Doctors, as well as three other interns, to analysis patients' mobility data and the key attributes affecting fall risk.
    </p>
    <h4>Codes</h4>
     <p>
       The project is strictly confidential and I cannot share any relevant data or code.
