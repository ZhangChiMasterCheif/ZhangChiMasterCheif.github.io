  <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
    <p>Transforming from <br>
      Information(my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai International Studies University) <br>
      to <br>
      Computer Science(my Master's degree at <A HREF="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-studies/mse-programs/">Johns Hopkins University</A>)<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Why This Transformation?</h4>
      <p>
         In my undergraduate studies, my advisor, <A HREF="http://baojunma.com/index_en.html">Prof. Baojun Ma</A>, gave me several hand-on coding projects. 
          I soon fell for the feeling of solving problems and buliding programs with codes, like engineers.<br>
         I then learned the basics of Deep Learning & Neural Networks from the 
          <A HREF="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Coursera courses</A> by Dr. Andrew Ng and found them very interesting.<br>
         Then I decided to learn computer science to go deeper.
      </p>
    <h4>How I'm Transformaing?</h4>
      <p>
         I'm focusing on Natrual Language Processing. I'm also pursuing the 
          <A HREF="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/human-language-technology-masters/">Human Language Technology (HLT) Masters Concentration</A> offered by 
          <A HREF="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu">JHU's CLSP</A>.
      </p>
    
  <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the following projects are official projects, with designated responsible institutions, clear goals, teamworks, pays and deadlines. 
       Some are school projects, like projects assigned by advisor, or course projects. And the rest are self-motivated projects.
    </p>
   <h3>Patient Fall Risk Assessment Project</h3>
    <p>
      This is a sub-project under the 
       <A HREF="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/physical_medicine_rehabilitation/education_training/amp/">Activity and Mobility Promotion (AMP)</A> project 
       with designated responsible institutions of <A HREF="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/">The Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</A> 
       and <A HREF="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/">Johns Hopkins Hospital</A>. <br>
      The project aims to understand the role of mobility for hospitalized patients and make assessment for patients' falling risks.<br>
      I'm working as a data analytic intern, with several Professors and Doctors, as well as three other interns, to analysis patients' mobility data and the key attributes affecting fall risk.
    </p>
    <b>Codes</b><br>
       The project is strictly confidential and I cannot share any relevant data or codes.
    <br>
   <h3>Human-Machine Collaborate Search Model</h3>
    <p>
      This is a joint project with designated responsible institutions of <A HREF="http://en.shisu.edu.cn/"> Shanghai International Studies University</A> 
       and <A HREF="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</A>. <br>
      Project aimed to develop a search model for text data generated on media, in a human-machine interaction scenario, 
       where the search results will be fine tuned after each human's collaboration. <br>
      I worked as the algorithm leader, Designed and implemented algorithm for the model. The algorithm mainly contains TF-IDF, Word2Vec for text vectorization, 
       a LDA method for text clustering, and cosine similarity for fine tuning after human interaction. The test for the algorithm is designed with perplexity and cross validation.
      <br>I also implemented a GUI for human-computer interaction.
    </p>
    <b>Codes</b><br>
       The project is under the protection of <A HREF="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c30834/202011/82354d98e70947c09dbc5e4eeb78bdf3.shtml">China Patent Law</A> 
        and I could not disclose relevant data or core codes.<br>
       However, I could share with you the first edition(click here) of my programs for the model, which is not the same with the final edition, therefore is not under the patent's protection.
    <br>
   <h3>FT Database & OneVoice Interactive Tool Project</h3>
    <p>
      This is an internship project under <A HREF="https://www.schneider-electric.cn/zh/">Schneider Electric</A>(Global Supply Chain, Shanghai-China).<br>
      The project aimed to develop an information system to help HRs better manage employee data and to help managers better understand employees' performance.<br>
      I worked as a digital intern to design and implement this information system. I set up a local database to store all the existing data of FTs (Functional Trainees).<br>
      Then I wrote programs for the easy handling of databases for managers on website using Django & PyEcharts with a a GUI that includes features such as searching for someone, checking for updates, changing the local database, and viewing Tableau visualization.
    </p>
    <b>Codes</b><br>
      The project is owned by Schneider Electric and I cannot share any relevant data or codes.
